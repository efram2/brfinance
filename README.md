```R
library(brfinance)

# Download inflation data for 2023
inflation <- get_inflation_rate("2023-01-01")
head(inflation)

# Retrieve SELIC rate from 2020 to 2024
selic <- get_selic_rate(2020, 2024)
head(selic)

# Retrieve unemployment data
unemployment <- get_unemployment(2020, 2024)
head(unemployment)
```
## Language Support

All functions support both English and Portuguese through the language parameter:

* language = "eng" (default): Returns English column names and labels
* language = "pt": Returns Portuguese column names and labels

## About the data

All data used in brfinance is retrieved from official Brazilian institutions:

* SGS (Sistema Gerenciador de SÃ©ries Temporais) by the Central Bank of Brazil
* SIDRA (Sistema IBGE de RecuperaÃ§Ã£o AutomÃ¡tica) by IBGE

The package aims to simplify the access and visualization of key Brazilian macroeconomic indicators, especially for researchers, students, and analysts who work with national economic data.
